# Spotify Song Finder

## Description

The **Spotify Song Finder** is a web application that allows users to search for songs or artists on Spotify. Using the Spotify Web API, the app displays song details such as:
- Song name
- Artist(s)
- Album name
- Release date
- A link to listen to the song on Spotify
- Optionally, it shows the album image and sorts the results by popularity or release date.

This application is built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and integrates with the **Spotify Web API**. It allows users to search for songs or artists, view their details, and sort the results by popularity or release date. 

## Features
- Search for songs or artists on Spotify
- View details for each track (name, artist, album, release date)
- Listen to the song directly on Spotify via a link
- Sort the results by popularity or release date (optional)
- "No Sorting" option to display the results in the order returned by Spotify
